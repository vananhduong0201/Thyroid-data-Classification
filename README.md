### Description
This is the classification project I had done at LUT University. The project is about a dataset  (“Thyroid_data”) from a test of Thyroid disease infections on selected patients. Thyroid is a major disorder that occurs due to the lack of the Thyroid hormone among women. It is not easy to determine the disorder manually based on the patients’ test reports. However, using a machine learning technique would make this task simpler by predicting the disorder. Your task is to detect whether a given patient is healthy (1) or suffers from hyperthyroidism (2) or suffers from hypothyroidism (3) by developing a model using classification. This model should in the future help to automatize the decisions on the patients who have a certain type of Thyroid disease (2)/ (3) or are healthy. The information of the features in the dataset are as follows:

- CLASS: class attribute (healthy (1) or hyperthyroidism (2) or hypothyroidism (3))
- T3: T3-resin uptake test results
- TST: Total Serum thyroxin as measured by the isotopic displacement method
- TSTR: Total serum triiodothyronine as measured by radioimmunoassay
- TSH: Basal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as measured by radioimmunoassay
- MAD-TSH: Maximal absolute difference of TSH value after injection of 200 micro grams of
thyrotropin-releasing hormone as compared to the basal value
